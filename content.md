# Technical Interview Prep

<!-- How technical interview is structured -->

The technical interview is a measure of your understanding of object oriented programming, coachability, communication, debugging, error handling, and proficiency with tools like VSCode and the terminal. You will be given a technical question and have ~20 minutes to work through it. We will be watching and assesing you as you work through the question. It can be a bit nerve wracking to have someone watch you while you code. So make sure to practice! 

Technical interviews are an unavoidable aspect of working in the technology field. It's best to practice now and build up your skills.


## Sample Technical Interview

https://github.com/DPI-WE/sample-technical-interview

- fork it
- open in a codespace (or locally)
- time yourself (20 minutes)

get comfortable with vs code and the command line

- `ruby app.rb` (in our case `birthday_cake.rb`)
- ls, cd, etc. 

- read the error messages
- talk through your thought process out loud. This helps us gauge your communication skills and understanding. Maybe talk to a rubber duck, cat or dog if you have one.

- Remember, we're here to help before (and during) interviews. If you don't know the answer feel free to ask! We operate under lock before key principle. We often wont give you the answer (key) until you ask us a question (lock).
